# About

    time could also be

    speculating about
    the past

    puzzling over
    the future

    estimating
    the present.

This project was developed in context of the exhibition "Punkt Punkt Komma Strich‚Äù about code and computer languages at the Museum of Literature in Marbach. An algorythm generates a poem describing the current time in poetry instead of numbers. The poem is then printed by a thermal printer as soon as the visitor pushes the button.

## Quick start

-   Setup a Raspberry Pi install. If you need to connect a headless setup to wifi you can use `wpa_supplicant.conf` but by now there should be an official, more convenient way for headless setup.
-   Clone repo to `/home/pi`
-   Create a venv called `venv` and activate it
-   Install requirements
-   Connect a button to GPIO 26
-   Setup your thermal printer. The script will assume `/dev/usb/lp0` is your printer, change that if necessary.
-   Use `start.sh` in a cron job to start on boot.

## FAQ

_Q: Why is this not an installable package?_

A: Had to hack this too quick to actually structure it properly. Not really a problem since this was never supposed to be released. Feel free to improve and contribute.

_Q: What printer should I use?_

A: We used an old Epson TM-T88 IV via USB.

_Q: What is OCRB Regular.ttf?_

A: The font we used. It's not included because of licensing.

_Q: Has anyone actually asked one of these questions?_

A: No but I realised I never wrote a readme so I thought maybe someone will see this and be happy to have like a bit of guidance.
